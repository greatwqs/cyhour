As a newbie iOS developer, I have a lot to learn.

If you tell me that learning can be fun back when I was an accountant, I will seriously doubt that. However, learning the skills to be a better developer is a different story. Learning is fun!

Looks at the fun stuff I have been learning since I switched my career:

1. Linux: the history of Linux amuse me, and I now know that many devices(like Mac and iPhone) I have been using are developed on Linux.
2. HTML+CSS+jQuery: Make my own website on my own, getting better on it.
RubyOnRails: Just get start working on it this week, backend server stuff is all new and fun to me.
3. iOS App Development: making and running App on my iPhone is satisfying.
4. Algorithm: math stuff is not actually fun, but using math to solve real life problem is cool.
5. Writing: a good developer should write well.

Yeah, I better get back to studying now.
