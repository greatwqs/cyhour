Git has a lot of features, and I bet that 90% of who use it (including me)
doesn't know half of them. Well, maybe, someday, one of those _"unknown features"_
can _"save your life"_.

So, I decided to compile a small list of useful git commands, tips and tricks
that I use or used sometime in my work.

Of course, if you have yours tricks/tips (and you probably have), comment above
the post or ping me at twitter/mail/anything, I'll be glad to add your tip and
put your name in it.

Let's do this.

----------

### [Do not rebase commits that have already been pushed to the remote repository](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing#The-Perils-of-Rebasing)


### See who and in which commit each line of a file was changed last time

```bash
git blame path/to/file
```

### See the reference log

This will show the log of your local operations in the git tree, useful to get
revision code of a specific action (see next item).

```bash
git reflog
```

**HEADS UP**: `reflog` will only have the logs of actions in your local repository,
more specifically, it will log each time the `HEAD` pointer changes, so, if clone
a repository right now, the reflog will be empty. Also, the reflog is maintained
for 30 days by default.


### Get revision code for anything

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD # last commit
git rev-parse HEAD~5 # 5 commits back from last commit
git rev-parse develop # last commit from develop branch
```

### Revert a specific file to a specific commit

```bash
git log path/to/file # to check the revision code
git checkout revision_code path/to/file
```

### Revert a specific file to last commit

```bash
git checkout HEAD path/to/file
```

### Revert a specific file to 3 commits back from last

```bash
git checkout HEAD~3 path/to/file
```

### Get an old version of some file

```bash
git show HEAD~3:path/to/file > path/to/file_3_commits_ago
```

### Shallow clone

According to the docs:

> Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of
revisions. A shallow repository has a number of limitations (you cannot clone
or fetch from it, nor push from nor into it), but is adequate if you are only
interested in the recent history of a large project with a long history, and
would want to send in fixes as patches.

So, if you want only the last revision:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap --depth 1
```

This can drastically reduce the clone. The bad thing is that you will have NO
HISTORY BEFORE THE HEAD WHEN YOU DO THE CLONE.

### Move a recent commit to another branch

This is pretty useful when you're working on something, commit, and them
realize that it would fit better in another branch (or that you're in the
wrong branch)... this is how to move it to another branch.

```bash
git branch new
git reset --hard HEAD~1 #go back 1 commit, YOU WILL LOST UNCOMMITED CHANGES
git checkout new
```

### Revert your entire tree to the last commit state
> by [@luizkowalski](https://github.com/luizkowalski)

Useful when you do some crap and want to throw it all away.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

You can also specify something like `HEAD~3` to get back 3 commits from HEAD.


### Remove files that have not been added to staging area
> by [@luizkowalski](https://github.com/luizkowalski)

```bash
git clean -df
```


### Stashing

> by [@thiagolenz](https://github.com/thiagolenz)

This is useful when you want to switch branches, but don't want to commit a
half-done work just to get back to it later.

```bash
git stash # save the current state
# later...
git stash pop # apply the stash to your current HEAD and remove it from your stack.
```

More info can be found [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing).

### Merge acting like it's an unique branch

> by [@thiagolenz](https://github.com/thiagolenz)

This will do the merge without creating the "merge commit", acting
much like SVN.

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

### Aliases

> by [@derekstavis](https://github.com/derekstavis)

You can setup aliases in git, so get smaller commands and save time. Examples:

```bash
# configuring...
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.s status

# using
git s
git co https://github.com/caarlos0/up
```

### Copy a file from one branch to another

Useful if you want a file that was introduced or modified in other branch. Example:

```bash
git checkout gh-pages
git checkout master -- teste.js
git commit -m "Update test.js from master"
```

### Log deleted files

> by [Ricardo Walter](https://twitter.com/ricardo_walter)

Show the commit log with the deleted files for each commit:

```bash
git log --diff-filter=D --summary
```

### Delete a branch

Local:

```bash
git branch -d name
git branch -D name # force delete unmerged branch
```

Remote:

> by [Ricardo Walter](https://twitter.com/ricardo_walter)

```bash
git push origin :branchname
```

### Undo your last commit

> by [Endrigo Antonini](https://github.com/antonini)

If you do a wrong commit, revert it, but maintain the changes in your staging
area.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD^
```

Just remember: `HEAD^` is a pointer to the parent of current `HEAD`, so, you
can use `HEAD~3` to go 3 commits back, for example. Also, check the `reflog`
part of this post.

### Remove a file from the last commit

PROTIP: Don't do this if you already pushed the commit.

For example, if you want to remove the `wrongfile.txt`, do:

```bash
git rm wrongfile.txt
git commit --amend
```

### Update submodules to last commit

Instead of `cd`ing each module, `checkout master` and `pull`, in git
1.8.2 you can simply do this:

```sh
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Troubleshooting

### `! c15fe9e..eee5f38  feature1 -> origin/feature1  (unable to update local ref)`

This error can vary by remote and branch name. Usually, a clean up will do
the job just fine:

```sh
git gc --prune=now
git remote -v | cut -f1 | uniq | xargs git remote prune
```

Done.

## Going Further

I **strongly** recommend the reading of the "[Pro Git][book]" book. The book
will teach tons of things: basics, importing SVN projects, advanced,
branching, servers, and git internals.
