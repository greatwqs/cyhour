This is a personal note on the book [Code Complete](http://cc2e.com). 

If you are a programmer and haven't read this book, I strongly recommend you reading it, check it out on [amazon][1].

## Part I: Laying the Foundation
### Chapter 3: Upstream Prerequisites
* The overarching goal of preparing for construction is risk reduction. Don't increase them.
* Part of a programmer’s job is to educate bosses and coworkers about the soft- ware-development process, including the importance of adequate preparation before programming begins.
* If a good problem definition hasn’t been specified, you might be solving the wrong problem during construction.

### Chapter 4: Key Construction Decisions
* Establish programming conventions before you begin programming. It’s nearly impossible to change code to match them later.
* More construction practices exist than you can use on any single project. Con- sciously choose the practices that are best suited to your project.

### Chapter 5: Design in Construction
* Classes and routines are first and foremost intellectual tools for reducing complexity.
* Software’s Primary Technical Imperative is managing complexity. This is greatly aided by a design focus on simplicity.
* Simplicity is achieved in two general ways: 
    * Minimize the amount of essential complexity that anyone’s brain has to deal with at any one time.
    * Keep accidental complexity from needlessly proliferating.
* Information hiding is a particularly valuable concept. Asking “What should I hide?” settles many difficult design issues.
