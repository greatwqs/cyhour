title: "Avoid static imports"
---

There are a lot of Java API's and Frameworks which rely in `static` methods and
the sort. Arguably, this is a bad OOP practice, but lets not enter in this
particular subject just yet.

For example, it is pretty common to write unit tests like this:

```java
package blah;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

import org.junit.Test;

public class SomeTest {

  @Test
  public void testSomething() {
    assertTrue(1 + 1 == 2);
  }
}
```

While it's kind of pretty to `import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue`
and use `assertTrue` directly instead of `Assert.assertTrue`, one might argue
that it's difficult to know where this `assertTrue` method came from. I
don't fully agree with that in this particular case because this is an isolated
and well known context (the test) and every Java developer knows
(or should know) Junit, therefore the `assertTrue` should be obvious.

What I believe not to be a good thing is this:

```java
package foo;

public enum FooType {
  BAR, ANOTHER;
}
```

Later:

```java
package bar;

import static foo.FooType.*;
import foo.BarService;

public class BarService {
  private FooService foo;

  public void update(Long id) {
    foo.update(id, BAR);
  }
}
```

Now, when other folks read this code, they will see this `BAR` there and will
have to discover where it come from. It's not the `Foo` context anymore and
it's not a well known API, so, how can people know where this came from?
It would be much simpler if it was written as `FooType.BAR`, right?
Besides, we just polluted the namespace with all `FooTypes`, which is also
a bad thing.

I know... static importing some stuff can make the code "prettier" or
look simpler. Yeah, nope. If your code is not simple or pretty enough, it's
not the job of static imports to fix it. Probably your design is just bad.

I'm not the only one who believe in this:

- There is a [checkstyle has a rule for it][check-rule];
- [Java Documentation about static imports][java-static-import].

Of course, if you follow the checkstyle rule, you will have no static imports
in your code. This can be a little "too much", but, if I had to choose
between static imports everywhere or no static imports at all, I'll surely
choose the later. But, what I really prefer, is the common sense.
