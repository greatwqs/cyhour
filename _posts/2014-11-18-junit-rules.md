title: "Using JUnit Rules to simplify your tests"
---

Have you ever wrote JUnit tests extending a class that does some before and
after work, so you didn't have to repeat that code in various test classes?
Well, I will not say that you have been doing it wrong, but, sure enough, you
could do it better. How? Using JUnit Rules!

## The Basics

Well, before we learn all that, let's start with the basics, shall we?

### Timeouts

Let's take a simple example: Suppose that you want to set a timeout for all
test methods in a given class, an easy way to do that is like this:

```java
public class BlahTest {
	@Test(timeout = 1000)
	public void testA() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test(timeout = 1000)
	public void testB() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test(timeout = 1000)
	public void testC() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test(timeout = 1000)
	public void testD() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test(timeout = 1000)
	public void testE() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	// ...
}
```

Besides that you repeated yourself tons of times, if you want to change
this timeout, you will have to change it in all methods. There is no need to
do that. Just use the `Timeout` Rule:

```java
public class BlahTest {
	@Rule
	public Timeout timeout = new Timeout(2000);

	@Test
	public void testA() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test
	public void testB() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test
	public void testC() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test
	public void testD() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	@Test
	public void testE() throws Exception {
		// ...
	}

	// ...
}
```

### Temporary Folder

Have you ever needed to do some test that uses `File` and/or needed a temporary
file/folder? `TemporaryFolder` to the rescue:

```java
public class BlahTest {
	@Rule
	public TemporaryFolder tempFolder = new TemporaryFolder();

	@Test
	public void testIcon() throws Exception {
		File icon = tempFolder.newFile("icon.png");
		// do something else...
	}
}
```

### Expected Exceptions

Ever needed more control on exceptions? Try the `ExpectedException` rule:

```java
public class BlahTest {
	@Rule
	public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none();

	@Test
	public void testIcon() throws Exception {
		exception.expect(IllegalArgumentException.class);
		exception.expectMessage("Dude, this is invalid!");
		// do something that you expect to throw an exception...
	}
}
```

## Custom Rules

That's neat, but... what if you need something else... something more "custom"?
Well, you can implement your own rules by implementing the `TestRule`
`interface`, for example, a Rule that init Mockito mocks (not very useful):

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MockRule implements TestRule {
  private final Object target;

  public Statement apply(Statement base, Description description) {
    return new Statement() {
      @Override
      public void evaluate() throws Throwable {
        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(target);
        base.evaluate();
      }
    };
  }
}
```

To use it, you just need to declare that rule in your test class:

```java
public class BlahTest {
	@Rule
	public MockRule mock = new MockRule(this);

	@Mock
	private BlahService service;

	@Test
	public void testBlah() throws Exception {
		Assert.assertThat(
			service.blah(),
			CoreMatchers.notNullValue()
		);
	}
}
```

### External Resources

Returning to the example of this post's first paragraph, you can also have
custom external resources rules by extending the `ExternalResource` class:

```java
public class MyServer extends ExternalResource {
  @Override
  protected void before() throws Throwable {
    // start the server
  }

  @Override
  protected void after() {
    // stop the server
	}
}
```

I believe that this makes more sense with Integration Tests, though. Also, in
this case, you probably would not want/need to start and stop the server
before and after each test method, right? So, you can use the `@ClassRule`
annotation:

```java
public class BlahServerTest {
	@ClassRule
	public static MyServer server = new MyServer();

	@Test
	public void testBlah() throws Exception {
		// test something that depends on the server.
	}
}
```

**Attention**: Note that when you use `@ClassRule`, your rule instance should
be `static`, just like `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` methods.

## Going Further

That's the basics that will save you tons of abstract classes and ugly code. I
would also recommend you to take a good read at the [junit wiki][docs]. If
you have any question, don't exitate to comment bellow, I will surely try to
answer them. :beer:
