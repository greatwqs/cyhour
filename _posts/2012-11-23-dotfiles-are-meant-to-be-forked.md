Well, it has been a while since I replaced my old (but gold) bash by the great
zsh.

Anyway, I have my personal computer and my job computer, and, like almost every
developer, I create aliases and scripts for everything I have to do repeatedly.

![Automate all the things!](http://www.anchor.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/automate-all-the-things1.png)

Well... you can imagine.. my `.bashrc` had about 300 lines. It was really big.
Almost impossible to share with others, full of personal data, full of my
machine specific data, bloated with old things I left behind... well, it was a
real mess.

Then, I decided to make a huge step in my life: move to [ZSH][zsh]!

## ZSH

> Zsh is a powerful shell that operates as both an interactive shell and as a
> scripting language interpreter. While being compatible with Bash (not by
> default, only if you issue "emulate sh"), it offers many advantages such as:
> Faster, Improved tab completion, Improved globbing, Improved array handling,
> Fully customizable.

But, well, I didn't knew where to start. So, I forked [oh-my-zsh][ohmyzsh]
project. I've used it for a while, also did some contributions... but well,
it has so many things I didn't use, and it doesn't had a simple way to share
configuration files across computers.

Then I found [holman's dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles). And it was
perfect! Except for the fact that it was full of Mac OS X-related stuff.

So I tweaked, removed, tweaked, cleaned-up, tweaked, etc etc, and there it is,
my all-new [dotfiles][dotfiles]!

They should work with both Linux and OS X (Linux lacks a little automation,
tough), and I tweaked it to fit my taste.

## so get it, bro

The installation is pretty straightforward. Just clone it in `~/.dotfiles` and
run the `script/bootstrap` file. If you found any error, please, open an issue
so I can fix them.

{% include project.html %}

Also, take a look at the [readme][readme] (pretty simple), it will make it easy
to you to understand the topics and other features.

If you want, you can also read the
[holman's post about his dotfiles](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

If you wanna contribute with anything, just issue a pull-request. I'll be glad
to take a look at it!

That's all folks, hope to see you soon!
