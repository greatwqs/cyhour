title: "GWT Bootstrap 2.0.4.0 released"
---

For those wo don't know, [GWT-Bootstrap](http://gwtbootstrap.github.com) wants to port the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com) widgets to GWT compatible and easy to use components/widgets.

I started this project earlier this year, and we finally released our first version.

You can see the official announcements [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/google-web-toolkit/3139Fyc_x3o%5B1-25%5D) and [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/gwt-bootstrap/yTjUxMe9eUg%5B1-25%5D).

I'll just copy and paste what I said in the first announcement linked here.

	As the creator of the project, I'll like to say something, if you guys don't mind =D

	First, I would like to apologize. Last months my life was changing too much, I don't has the time and willpower to contribute as much I want to.
	Second, I would like to thank very much some persons:

	Keisuke aka 'Soundtricker' - He just take the lead of the project when I'm not with time to do that, and made a lot of  other very good contributions. Thank you very much bro, you're awesome.
	Dominik Mayer - he's the first guy who give some importance to the project, when it is just a 'test', and he talk with keisuke and yusuke to help the project, thank you very much bro, you're awesome.
	Yusuke - he give a lot of help around the project. Thank you bro, you're awesome!
	All the other commiters and all the people that use GWT-Bootstrap and report bugs, give suggestions, etc - You, guys, are the people that made we believe in our project, and give us a reason to continue it. Thanks, you're awesome.

	I think that that's it.

	Thanks everyone, I hope you enjoy this first release, and hope that more releases come soon :)


	Cheers.

I want to, again, thank everyone that made this happens, you guys are just awesome.

Right now, GWT-Bootstrap is for the first time disponible in the [Maven Central Repositories](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.github.gwtbootstrap%7Cgwt-bootstrap%7C2.0.4.0%7Cjar), you can change your `pom.xml` to use the stable version like this:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.gwtbootstrap</groupId>
	<artifactId>gwt-bootstrap</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Now, we will work to port the components that wasn't in this first release, and also update to Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0
([which this blog is already using](/posts/upgrading-jekyll-bootstrap)).

I also want to, again, apologize. Last weeks my life was changing in much ways, and I didn't has all the time and energy that I like, so, I didn't made much contributions... but, in few weeks it will be more 'stable', and them I'll back with the fury of a hundred billion suns.

Thats all.

Cheers.
