title: "Docker Protipsâ„¢"
---

Like my old post [on git]({% post_url 2013-02-08-git-protips %}),
this is somewhat a collection of useful Docker commands/tricks/whatever.

Feel free to leave yours in the comments!

### Stop all containers

```sh
$ docker stop $(docker ps -qa)
```

- `ps -qa` will output the `CONTAINER_ID` of all containers;
- `stop` will get `ps -qa` as input and stop all of them.

You can also `kill` all running containers instead of stop them.

### Delete all stopped containers

```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps -qa -f="exited=0")
```

- `ps -qa` will output the `CONTAINER_ID` of all containers;
- `-f="exited=0"` flag will tell `docker ps` to filter by exited containers
only;
- `rm` will remove the container.

This command is particularly useful if you tested a lot of stuff in your
machine which is now running out of disk space.

### Delete all images

```sh
$ docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```

- `images -q` will output the `IMAGE_ID` of all known images;
- `rmi -f` will force delete all the given images.

### Delete unused images

```sh
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock bobrik/image-cleaner
```

### Kitematic

If you use a Mac, managing `boot2docker` by hand can be a little "boring",
you can use [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) for that.
