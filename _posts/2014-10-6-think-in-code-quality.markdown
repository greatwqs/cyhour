These days I moved to a new house, read a few pages of < Code Complete >.
Surprisingly, I find coding and house keeping share a lot in common.

Write as few code as possible, one thing I learned from Code Complete. If you
write bad codes, they will grow widely as time passes. If I buy more
and more furnitures for my house, I have to spend more money/time on
cleaning, organizing and moving them.

Coders keep saying that naming variables is the major task of they daily
job. I thought it was a joke.

But I now know that it isn't. Naming variables is the key process of
abstracting the real world.

As said in Code Complete, the primary permitive of coding is reducing complexity. Well named classes, methods and variables help us to form good abstraction from what we are building. And abstraction is important.

So, to improve my code quality, I should code less but think more.
