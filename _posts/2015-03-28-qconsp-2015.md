title: "QCon Sao Paulo - 2015: A short overview"
---

So, this week I attended to [QCon-SP](http://qconsp.com/).

The conference was great (congratulations everyone :beers:),
but, I thought it would be nice to do an overview.

So, the top subjects were Microservices and Docker. A lot
of Big Data too, but I like the Microservices thing more, so
I didn't follow the Big Data track.

We saw a lot of company culture too, and, believe it or not,
it was strongly related to Microservices.

Let me explain.

Basically, they defend small teams (5-8 people), each team
owning one or more Microservices. The team is responsible for
both develop and deploy those services, basically,
**the teams are multidisciplinary**. The **teams**, not the
**people**.

Also, a real Microservice should be **independent**.
Microservices sharing the same database are not Microservices.

The philosophy behind Microservices is based on Unix
[Philosophy][philosophy]:

Of course you probably won't do that from day-1 in your new
startup. You don't even know if it will work, and, Microservices
add a little of complexity you might not want to pay now.

About this, two quotes by

And, as expected, Docker seems to be now the pop thing to use to deploy
Microservices. Even [Microsoft is working on it][ms-docker].

There is a lot of cool things that you can do with it right now, and there
will probably be more soon, like running desktop softwares inside a Docker
container and freezing user space to turn on a Docker container in a "warm"
state - which seems nice if you think about JVM JIT, for example.

I wish I had attended to the [Docker tutorial by Jerome][fast-paced], but,
unfortunately, that was not possible. There were very little practical stuff
about Docker in talks and keynotes, but they were nice anyway.

See you next year!
