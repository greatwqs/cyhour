title: "Turbolinks animated page transitions"
---

Since I've seen the new [Basecamp][base], I fall in love with it.

It's fast, had sleek animations in page changes and so on.

Well, I put one thing in my head: "if they can, I can". So I worked. Can get a
really good speed with a 1Gb RAM + SSD HD from [DigitalOcean][digital]
for $ 10 per month (really cheap, I believe), and tweaked my app to use
the [Puma][puma] server (with socket, of course) + [Nginx][nginx] (that also
serves the assets), [cache-digest][cache] GEM to up the irons while caching
things, and [turbolinks][turbolinks] for a really simple AJAX (done with pushstate)
(I'll talk about this architecture another day).

Well, I'm pretty happy, except that I don't had those awesome bad-ass animations
on page change. So, I made it.

### [turbolinks_transitions][transitions]

![example](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/247142/blog/lol/turbolinks_transition.gif "Just a cool animated gif with the example!")

Use it is pretty simple. Just add the gem and import the JS, and you're
ready to go!

See the complete how to use [here][usage].
