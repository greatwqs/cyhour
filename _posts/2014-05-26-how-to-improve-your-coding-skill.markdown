Start TDD
=========

*TDD definition*

*agileskillsproject.org*: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of driving the design of code by
writing a test which expresses what you intend the code to do, making that
test pass, and continuously refactoring to keep the design as simple as
possible. TDD can apply at multiple levels, e.g., Customer Tests, Integration
Tests, Unit Tests.

Test-Driven Development/Design follows a rigorous cycle. Start by writing a
failing test (Red.) Implement the simplest solution that will cause the test
to pass (Green.) Search for duplication and remove it (Refactor.)
"RED-GREEN-REFACTOR" has become almost a mantra for many TDD practitioners.
Understanding and even internalizing this cycle is key to being able to use
TDD to solve problems.

*why?*

1. Avoid procrastination;

2. It saves time, really; Without Test Driven, you are consistently thinking 'what should i do next'. With Test Driven, the test will tell you what to do next(it breaks if the logic is not there, so you just need to fix the broken part). Also, you have less bugs, which will save you a lot of time in the long run.[How to get started on TDD with Ruby on Rails?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1386562/how-to-get-started-on-tdd-with-ruby-on-rails)

*how?*

1. Just do it, go back to the book or online resources once you encounter a question or problem. This is agile too.

2. Get start and a lot of resources: [TDD in Rails](http://edapx.com/2013/01/12/tdd-in-rails/)

Best Practices
==============
1. Search online for best practices as soon as you have programming in a language
   for a while.
2. Examples: [JQuery Best Practices](http://gregfranko.com/jquery-best-practices/#/).

Looking for help
================
1. Use english to describe your problem;
2. Read english documents as much as possible. It will also help you to describe problems and terms in english.
3. Refers to official documents.
4. Search github for existing solutions.
5. Stackoverflow a lot.

Learning By Teaching
========
1. Contributing on github projects;
2. Answering stackoverflow open questions;
3. Topic sharings;
