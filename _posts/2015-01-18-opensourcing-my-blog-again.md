title: "OpenSourcing my blog again"
---

Once upon a time, my blog was OpenSource. People liked it and forked it tons
of times, but they never change some stuff (disqus, analytics).

I got irritated and closed it.

Now, I'm reopening it again. I improved the README so I hope now it's clear
that people should change some stuff.

Hope you like it.
