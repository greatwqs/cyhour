Hello everyone :)

I just decided to start posting in my own blog, in English.
I had a blog with some friends. The posts were
written in Portuguese, it's Wordpress, and I my last post was a long time ago
(because it's boring post in wordpress).

I don't really like Wordpress. Yeah, I just don't like it. I think thats is
heavy and slow. So, I decided to give a chance to
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

I'll not blog about "*how to setup jekyll*", you can read it
[here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

It's realy simple to configure, put to work, write posts, pages, and I can see
the modifications easy in my local server :)
And yeah, it's really fast.

In a few minutes, I updated the
[twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version, hacked
Jekyll to be responsive, cleaned home listing the latest posts and setup author
and other things.
It also have built-in support for Disqus and Twitter/G+/Facebook/etc
(aka addthis) buttons.

In short: Jekyll is great, and I really like it!
